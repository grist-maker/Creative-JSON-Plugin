A quick, easy way to generate JSON schema to be used with any type of creative work.

== Description ==

Creative JSON Plugin is a generator which uses user filled fields to create a working, accurate JSON
schema for creative works. It uses all input provided, while ignoring those fields that are empty,
to customize the schema for the user in question. It is free to use, and available through its own
page to allow easy copy and pasting of the schema into the desired page or section without placing it
automatically on a page that may not be desirable. This allows the user to stay in control of exactly
what happens with the generated schema without the plugin making these decisions on the user's behalf.

== Installation ==
1. Upload folder to /wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate plugin off of the same wordpress page through the Plugins menu.
3. Click the JSON Query page on the left menu to access the generator.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Do I need to cite the use of this plugin? 
No, feel free to use for any purpose without citing. It is simply an add on to help enhance
website coding practices for those who havenâ€™t memorized the rather extensive number of fields
available for creative work JSON schemas.

Do you plan on updating this in the future?
No, but the general guidelines that are used here should work unless WordPress changes its
coding format in an update, in which case it will still be accessible on an installation of the
earlier WordPress version.
